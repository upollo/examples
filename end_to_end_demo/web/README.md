## Getting Started

Firstly, run install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Secondly, set your Upollo private API key in `.env`. See our [Quickstart guide](https://upollo.ai/docs/quick-start#sign-up) on how to get an API key.

Thirdly, make sure you have either the Go, Python, or NodeJS server running.

To run pointing at your local development server:

- `npm run startLocal`: to use the local Go or Python server
- `npm run startLocalNode`: to use the local Node.js server

Open [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001) with your browser to see the result.
