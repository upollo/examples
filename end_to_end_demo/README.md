This demo contains and end-to-end web application that demonstrates how to use Upollo's APIs from a web client and backend server.

## Server

There are 3 different servers to choose from depending on the language you would like to use:
1. `server`: NodeJS
1. `server_go`: Go
1. `server_python`: Python

The servers all listen on port 8001 for incomming requests and provide the same API for the client to call.

See the README in each server's root directory for instructions on how to run.

## Client

The web client is written in React. See the README in the `web` directory for instructions on how to run.
